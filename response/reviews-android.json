I do not recommend.","thumbsUp":34,"title":null,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wire&reviewId=8fa5b034-18f0-4d48-9351-693954f11cef","userImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/AAcHTtdXZ9VvJXhYt8Qa-bIoRcshN9Yc87-s5JVhSZNI5vM=mo","userName":"Kassie A","version":"v4.1.0(6252022)-prod"},{"criterias":[],"date":"2023-04-24T23:54:34.656Z","id":"86fd1a75-3732-4b1f-806b-fab2bb34baf7","replyDate":"2023-04-25T10:22:25.533Z","replyText":"\nWe are really sad to see this review.
