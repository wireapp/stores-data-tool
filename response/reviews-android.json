The biggest one is messages disappearing. I'll get a notification for a message but when I check it, it's gone. (they're not deleting it, they'll send screenshots showing that the message sent). When sending pics, the pic will show for a few seconds then disappear (without the delete timer on). Also, when I get a connection request, it often won't let me accept, so I have to decline then send a request to them.","thumbsUp":57,"title":null,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wire&reviewId=c35e3f97-2b6f-415c-85e7-9b3ea6f4f889","userImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SihPHO6SEhiXwXPokAyatvezWh6ZK546xSx8wNSw","userName":"Cannon Davenport","version":"3.82.38"},{"criterias":[{"criteria":"vaf_never_display_ease_of_use","rating":null},{"criteria":"vaf_never_display_ads_experience","rating":null}],"date":"2022-08-31T22:25:48.369Z","id":"37355c91-84d5-4d92-b862-882ad8f6c47c","replyDate":"2022-09-02T10:53:39.260Z","replyText":"Hello Karin,\n\nThis could have been a first time sync issue you faced after the initial update.\nIf you are still facing an issue please raise a ticket at https://support.wire.com/hc/en-us\n\nThanks\nWire Customer Support","score":2,"scoreText":"2","text":"It was fantastic at first.
