I'm using this on an android device & it's impossible to use. I'm in a couple of group chats and its constantly crashing and freezing. I've been trying to reply to a comment for 30 mins. I give up. It's also causing other apps on my tablet to run slow & crash when it's open. Please fix these issues, I like the concept and layout etc but it's the worst messenger app I've ever used.","thumbsUp":23,"title":null,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wire&reviewId=76ccc22b-b0e6-47f0-b41c-c898033555cd","userImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKZY4VAGs20ajyvhcy1oV3yFSQsGUUkvEjjJdXnLfIMKZU=mo","userName":"Francesca Eve","version":"3.52.927"},{"criterias":[],"date":"2020-08-18T06:58:35.208Z","id":"eda26fc6-3ad6-4fa6-b183-333b88e8c3a0","replyDate":null,"replyText":null,"score":5,"scoreText":"5","text":"Security","thumbsUp":0,"title":null,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wire&reviewId=eda26fc6-3ad6-4fa6-b183-333b88e8c3a0","userImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVr5YXHWeqY9zEH82Sri2nCIQAYc2KEJvDyVwBfGW3vsq08","userName":"Shady Basiony","version":"3.52.927"},{"criterias":[],"date":"2020-08-16T04:03:52.862Z","id":"648c25df-e802-4dc8-a495-736f1ae3bdc4","replyDate":null,"replyText":null,"score":5,"scoreText":"5","text":"Excellent work very good aap Mushkil time me sath dene vala aap bnaya h","thumbsUp":0,"title":null,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wire&reviewId=648c25df-e802-4dc8-a495-736f1ae3bdc4","userImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW-sbSP3lAeBXDfwFSjLvyuZS5FPqj7-xc-El8JTVrvOwE","userName":"Yash Rana","version":null},{"criterias":[{"criteria":"vaf_never_display_inappropriate_ads","rating":2},{"criteria":"vaf_phase1_remote_desktop","rating":1},{"criteria":"vaf_phase1_searching_contacts","rating":1}],"date":"2020-08-15T19:54:13.323Z","id":"67a87252-1877-453e-8378-358d064fee0e","replyDate":null,"replyText":null,"score":5,"scoreText":"5","text":"Good for gameing","thumbsUp":0,"title":null,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wire&reviewId=67a87252-1877-453e-8378-358d064fee0e","userImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX_0s9tGLOruvhej7LTmKsEGbm16Zb6hK63aD-Te38Dg4A","userName":"Ryan Vannote","version":"3.52.927"},{"criterias":[],"date":"2020-08-13T21:11:41.560Z","id":"e78688f2-2f09-47c0-9bc5-7b59276d1ce2","replyDate":"2020-08-13T08:09:13.326Z","replyText":"Hello,\nUnfortunately our Android app does not support Chromebooks.
