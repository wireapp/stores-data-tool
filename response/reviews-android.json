Can we have an ETA on when we will be able to change the ringtone and notification tone and also when we will be able to see if messages have been delivered? I no longer have a ring tone when I get a call, so have to be constantly watching my phone. Wish we could go back to the old version.","thumbsUp":4,"title":null,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wire&reviewId=ab4f6a71-a3b8-4bbd-96d7-73e819bb3bdf","userImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVwQyFRYVS_E5NKDM_FAI_nvOs4IQMV-90RejKR_PoO2YI","userName":"Stace Sellars","version":"v4.1.6(6518403)-prod"},{"criterias":[{"criteria":"vaf_never_display_ads_experience","rating":null},{"criteria":"vaf_never_display_ease_of_use","rating":null}],"date":"2023-05-31T21:50:41.655Z","id":"2357ffaf-a05e-488f-a13e-a4243c60ccf5","replyDate":null,"replyText":null,"score":5,"scoreText":"5","text":"Excellent","thumbsUp":0,"title":null,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wire&reviewId=2357ffaf-a05e-488f-a13e-a4243c60ccf5","userImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVj0zkRgASYWPh8HbnpXwEC6H4A1o2xjuVVr8-TKSKw","userName":"Kawr Kiani","version":"3.82.38"},{"criterias":[{"criteria":"vaf_never_display_ads_experience","rating":null},{"criteria":"vaf_never_display_ease_of_use","rating":null}],"date":"2023-05-30T18:50:27.153Z","id":"8562f16e-496a-472f-a639-dba1c128ee92","replyDate":"2023-06-02T10:22:43.710Z","replyText":"We are sorry to hear that you're having issues with the app. We'd like to improve.

But unfortunately, the latest update is buggy. On one of my phone, it has become very slow at opening and retrieving conversations, while on another phone with a more recent android, I can share my pictures any longer. The wire share menu is gone when I tap the share symbol from the picture app. All I get is the wire conversation menu instead.
