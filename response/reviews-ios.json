It's gotten better, and it has SO much potential, but with each release it seems to get more polished on the surface without  any work on the foundation. The ability to make adjustments is useless and unintuitive at absolute best, with an appalling lack of basic necessary options. The notification system is STILL just as broken and useless as it was in the earliest versions. How could that not have been properly fixed by now? That utterly annoying reminder box to add contacts that you can't dismiss, even when you already have the contacts you want, and use the app to chat with them. Useless and annoying. I could go on, but the reality is that wire at its heart is a great app, and could be a wonderful replacement for Skype, which I can imagine I'm not alone in this thinking. And it has a user base who wants to use it, but the wire team is not fixing the basic issues that need to be fixed. If wire ever expects to have wide adoption of its app, it needs to start working on what matters. You have a great interface, but if it doesn't work right under the hood, it's useless. I want to love this app, I've gotten friends to use it, but progress where it counts is slow or so far non existent. That won't cut it.

Always on end-to-end encryption ensures all messages remain secure, which is a MUST.\n\nWhile I appreciate that Wire uses Free (as in freedom) and Open Source software to handle the encryption, I don't believe the entire app is open source, which leaves the potential for a hidden flaw or backdoor. Until the app is fully open sourced, I continue to recommend Signal from Openwhispersystems instead.","title":"Gorgeous app that takes bold steps to protect privacy","updated":"2016-03-10T21:13:45-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"gooberSmash","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id112089836","version":"2.0"},{"id":"1334586437","score":5,"text":"Wire has made a lot of improvement since I first started using it","title":"Great new update","updated":"2016-02-17T15:48:15-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"haydenkai","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id213130179","version":"1.27"},{"id":"1331896711","score":4,"text":"ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖÿ¨ ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ ŸàŸäÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸáŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇŸäŸäŸÖ ŸÑŸÉŸÜ ŸÜÿßŸÇÿµŸá ÿ®ÿπÿ∂ ÿßŸÑÿÆŸäÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™ ŸÖÿ´ŸÑ ÿ™ÿ∫ŸäŸäÿ± ÿÆŸÑŸÅŸäŸá ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿßÿ™ \nChange the chatt wallpaper from with to anything else","title":"Ÿäÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸáŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖÿ¨","updated":"2016-02-12T08:50:15-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"majedrko","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id291287457","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1329647884","score":5,"text":"ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ®ÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖÿ¨ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ®ŸÇŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿµÿßÿ™ (ÿßŸÑÿßŸäŸÅŸàŸÜ Ÿà ÿßŸÑÿßŸÜÿØÿ±ŸàŸäÿØ Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸàŸäŸÜÿØŸàÿ≤) Ÿà ÿßÿ¥ÿ™ÿ∫ŸÑ ÿπŸÜÿØŸä ÿπÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑ ÿ®ÿ≥ ŸÖŸÜ ÿ≠ÿ∑Ÿäÿ™Ÿá ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑÿßŸäÿ®ÿßÿØ ŸÖÿß Ÿäÿ¥ÿ™ÿ∫ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿß ÿßÿ∑ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸàÿßŸä ŸÅÿßŸä Ÿà ÿßŸÅÿ™ÿ≠Ÿá ÿßÿ™ŸÖŸÜŸâ ÿ™ÿµŸÑÿ≠ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑÿ© ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßÿØŸÖ","title":"ŸÖÿß Ÿäÿ¥ÿ™ÿ∫ŸÑ","updated":"2016-02-07T21:00:40-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"HE English","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id466647084","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1329274352","score":5,"text":"Very nice and clear voice","title":"Good","updated":"2016-02-07T03:46:09-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜÿØŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨ŸáŸàŸÑ","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id322979570","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1328111078","score":5,"text":"excellent beginning","title":"Good job","updated":"2016-02-05T02:09:56-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"The Pingo 92","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id260198729","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1327239854","score":5,"text":"ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ ŸÉÿ∞ÿß ŸäÿßÿπŸÖ ŸÉŸÑŸÖ ÿ®ÿ®ŸÑÿßÿ¥ ŸÑŸà ÿ¥ÿ®ŸÉÿ© ÿ∂ÿπŸäŸÅÿ©","title":"ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤","updated":"2016-02-03T09:51:16-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"AlQitlah22422","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id289440315","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1327218559","score":4,"text":"ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖÿ¨ ÿ¨ŸÖŸäŸÑ ŸÑŸÉŸÜ Ÿäÿßÿ±Ÿäÿ™ ÿßÿ∂ÿßŸÅÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ∫Ÿá ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®ŸäŸá","title":"ÿπÿ±ÿßŸÇ","updated":"2016-02-03T08:48:46-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"ÿπŸÄŸÄŸÄüòòŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÑŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÄüòòŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÄŸÄŸä","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id416652972","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1326739082","score":5,"text":"very good","title":"very good","updated":"2016-02-02T11:01:07-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"Zaiiiiiid","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id471396942","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1326653375","score":4,"text":"The best sound quality yet, four stars for missing video function yet","title":"The best sound quality yet","updated":"2016-02-02T07:03:51-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"Humbleman2202","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id458349915","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1326214846","score":5,"text":"Very good game","title":"Very good game","updated":"2016-02-01T10:56:23-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"Jamal jojo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id404689000","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1325927006","score":5,"text":"V gods","title":"Vvvvv","updated":"2016-01-31T22:40:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"m005hel","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id109768766","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1325891086","score":4,"text":"It started to Crash after putting ma # and activating it","title":"Crash","updated":"2016-01-31T21:05:46-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=930944768&type=Purple%20Software","userName":"Catch9","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id431087387","version":"1.26"},{"id":"1325086976","score":1,"text":"After downloading and then started to crash in every time i try to open.
