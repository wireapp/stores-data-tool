It's gotten better, and it has SO much potential, but with each release it seems to get more polished on the surface without  any work on the foundation. The ability to make adjustments is useless and unintuitive at absolute best, with an appalling lack of basic necessary options. The notification system is STILL just as broken and useless as it was in the earliest versions. How could that not have been properly fixed by now? That utterly annoying reminder box to add contacts that you can't dismiss, even when you already have the contacts you want, and use the app to chat with them. Useless and annoying. I could go on, but the reality is that wire at its heart is a great app, and could be a wonderful replacement for Skype, which I can imagine I'm not alone in this thinking. And it has a user base who wants to use it, but the wire team is not fixing the basic issues that need to be fixed. If wire ever expects to have wide adoption of its app, it needs to start working on what matters. You have a great interface, but if it doesn't work right under the hood, it's useless. I want to love this app, I've gotten friends to use it, but progress where it counts is slow or so far non existent. That won't cut it.
